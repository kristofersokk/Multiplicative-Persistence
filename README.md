# Multiplicative persistence

Just a project to self-teach the Kotlin language.
Idea for this project came from a Numberphile video on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wim9WJeDTHQ

Caches results it finds in a json file.
Currently database integration doesn't work.

Soon can with little modifications also work in bases below 10 as well.
